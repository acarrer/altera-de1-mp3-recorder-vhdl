Presentation of the project "Portable Recorder" 

The project aims to use the Altera DE1 board as simulator of a portable audio recorder and tries to take advantage of some capacity and I / O ports of the card: 

1) Sampler and ADC converter to record audio; 

2) LineIn and Mic Audio Inputs; 

3) Audio Output via LineOut using DAC Converter; 

4) SDRAM to store the sampled audio and read it during reproduction; 

5) Connection to a VGA monitor to display the audio waveform.
